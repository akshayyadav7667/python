#  Tuples in python

#  A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequenece of values.


#  list are mutable , which is changes by index 
#  Tuples or string is immutable, its means which can't be changed 

# tup=(3,4,5,533,5,47,76)

# print(type(tup))

# print(tup)

# tup[1]=45454        TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# print(tup[1:5])      (4, 5, 533, 5)

# print(tup.index(47))   return the index of first occurence 

# print(tup[2])     print the value of the index of tup =2


# print(tup.count(5))   print the total number of occurence in the tuple
